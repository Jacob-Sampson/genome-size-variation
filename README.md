Investigating genome size variation using k-mers

Genome size can vary between individuals of the same species. One example are parasitic eyebright plants ([*Euphrasia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphrasia)), where intraspecific genome size variation can range up to 30% ([Becher et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcab102)).

This repository contains code to inverstigate which genome fractions underpin these differences.
